I contributed to several projects that applied multi-state models to clinical data. One key project focused on identifying risk factors for patients with Ewing sarcoma. A multi-state model, like the one shown on the left, can capture multiple health events a patient may experience. It allows for the modeling of risk factors associated with each transition between different "states" in a patient's health journey. Additionally, such models enable predictions for individual patients, helping inform clinical decision-making.
