## About Me

I am your Statistician Next Door, a Peruvian-German native who studied mathematics and statistics in Germany and the Netherlands, and is currently residing in beautiful Austria with her family of three. 

During my master’s studies, I gained initial experience in statistical consulting through coursework and an internship at the [Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC)](https://www.lumc.nl). The results of this internship helped secure funding from the [KWF Dutch Cancer Society](https://www.kwf.nl/) for my PhD research at the [Mathematical Institute of Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics), during which I closely collaborated with researchers from the LUMC as part of the [Data Analysis and Survival for Personalised Oncology group](https://sites.google.com/view/daspo). Apart from conducting my own research, I also provided consulting services to researchers at the LUMC. My dissertation was awarded the [C.J. Kok Jury Award](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2021/02/anja-ruten-budde-wins-c.j.-kok-jury-award) for best thesis by the Faculty of Science at Leiden University. After obtaining my doctorate, I pursued a postdoc at the [Erasmus University Medical  Center](https://www.erasmusmc.nl/en/), where I provided consulting services to medical researchers as well.

My enjoyment of working on consulting projects inspired me to start my own statistical consulting business. This venture combines my desire for helping people, my passion for statistics, and the autonomy that comes with self-employment.

I am a native German speaker, but have done consulting work in English and Dutch, and have a conversational level in Spanish. I hope I can make you feel comfortable by communicating in your own language. Especially in statistics, communication is so important!
